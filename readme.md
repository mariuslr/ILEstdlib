## ILEstdlib

ILEstdlib is a service program that will expose APIs to make working with ILE applications a bit easier when working with strings, arrays, etc.

While most of the modules are written in C, we are aiming for them to work in ILE RPG applications.

#### Planned modules:

* Strings
* Dynamic arrays
* Simpler system APIs
* More to come
